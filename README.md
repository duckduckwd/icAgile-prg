# Build Tools

## Overview

This learning module is to introduce how complex software projects are built.
These can be used as part of teaching and/or as the base for video content to be housed on Cloud Academy.  MD can be converted to PPTX using Pandoc.

## Concrete Practice

This provides a guided activity to allow learners to demonstrate their skills and understanding of the topic area.
