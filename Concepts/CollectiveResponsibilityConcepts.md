# Collective Responsibility

## Collaborative Development

### Collective Accountability

Collective responsibility is one of the artefacts of agile software development realized those days in many companies and teams

- Promotes teamwork
- Role Blurring
  - Sharing knowledge with the team to get the work done

### Collective Ownership

Everyone on the team owns ALL of the system which includes the code

Whoever is best equipped to work on any part of the system is empowered to act

Allows code to be shared collectively

- If a fix is required, the first person who knows how to fix it and wants to will go ahead and do it

Pair programming supports the idea of collective ownership

### Type of Collective Ownership

#### Owner-only

When one individual owns the code, required features are often put in the wrong place as one programmer discovers that he needs to put a new feature into some code that he does not own

#### Any-pair

Any pair of programmers can improve any of the code at any time. Benefit of this is that all the code gets the attention of many people

#### Any-one-person

Any individual who is best equipped to work on any part of the system is empowered to act

Collective ownership can cause problems if individuals work on code they donâ€™t understand Pair programming can avoid this by as the programmer without much knowledge of the code can work with an expert
