# Readable Tests Concrete Practice (C#)

* Work in pairs.

Open solution in Starter.

## To Do

Identify all tests that have poor names. That could be most of them.

Agree on a naming convention and then rename all of the poorly named tests.

You may consider using common design steps for unit testing as follows:

1. Setting up fixtures (creating test objects)
2. Writing assertions (one assert per test case method)
3. Writing cleanup method (`IDisposeable.Dispose` implementations)
