# Refactoring with Existing Tests (JavaScript)

Locate the Starter folder and run an `npm i` for the project on the command line.

Run the tests by using the command `mocha ShoppingBasket.tests.js`.

Observe that all of the tests pass.

Run the file by using the command `node ShoppingBasket.js`.

Observe the output on the terminal.

## TO DO

Examine the code in the file **ShoppingBasket.js**.  Using the different refactoring principles, identify where some refactoring could potentially be done.

Add comments to your code to highlight these and begin to refactor the code.

**NOTE**:  All tests must still pass when your refactoring is done.
