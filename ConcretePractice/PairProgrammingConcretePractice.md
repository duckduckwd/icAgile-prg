# Pair Programming Concrete Practice

Complete this exercise using the most appropriate Pair Programming method suited to your pair.
If you are 'flying solo' then complete the coding but try to adopt a methodology.

You will need to set up a project for this activity in your repository as there is no base code.

## Task 1

Create a class file to represent a **BankAccount** class.
It should include fields such as:

* Customer name
* Account Number
* Balance
and methods such as:
* Deposit
* Withdraw

Your class should compile. There is no need to write any client code.

## Task 2

Create 2 more classes file to represent extensions of the **Bank Account**:

* One class should represent a *current/checking account* and can therefore go overdrawn.
* The other class should represent a *savings account* and therefore, may not go overdrawn. However, interest may be added.

Your class should compile. There is no need to write any client code.

## Task 3

Create two classes: Customer, BankAccount.

Each class should have a single responsibility.

The bank account class should represent a savings account.

*Whole Activity Time Box:* **20 minutes**
