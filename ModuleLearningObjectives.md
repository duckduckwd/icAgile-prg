# Dealing With Legacy Code

## Objectives

- Select an approach and apply techniques to refactor a legacy codebase, using both test-first and test-after
- Discuss different approaches to working with legacy code and explain the benefits & pitfalls associated with each approach
- Apply techniques based on the language chosen:
  - In languages with refactoring tools, such as Java and C#, learning how to use the refactoring tools to make safe changes
  - In statically typed languages, such as C++, breaking the work down into steps where the compiler will catch mistakes
  - In dynamic languages without refactoring tools, breaking the work down into steps which are less likely to have errors
- Apply techniques for adding tests to a codebase that is not designed for testability
  - Not all techniques are applicable to all languages, so the hands-on experience will be language specific
