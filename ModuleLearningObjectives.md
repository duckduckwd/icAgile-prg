## Objectives

- Drive development using the ATDD cycle using a variety of formats and tools
- Practice and apply driving the TDD cycle with acceptance tests
- Practice and apply expressing the same test in different forms (and with different tools): text-based (such as cucumber), table (such as FIT), and in code (such as xUnit)
