# Git as a Distributed Version Control System

## Overview

This learning module is to introduce some basic GIT concepts and commands. For deeper learning please refer to other modules.

## Connections

This module should follow on from What Is Version Control, so connections should already have been made.

## Concepts

These can be used as part of teaching and/or as the base for video content to be housed on Cloud Academy.  MD can be converted to PPTX using Pandoc.

## Concrete Practice

The Concrete Practice section will be covered in the follow-on module "Git in 5 minutes" if required.
