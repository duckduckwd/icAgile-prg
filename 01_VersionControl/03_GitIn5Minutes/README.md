# Git in 5 minutes

## Overview

This learning module is to introduce basic concepts and commands in Git to allow learners to start to use it quickly without needing in-depth training.

## Connection

This module is intended to be a follow on from "What is Version Control" and "Git as a DVCS" - relevant connections should have been covered there.

## Concepts

These can be used as part of teaching and/or as the base for video content to be housed on Cloud Academy.  MD can be converted to PPTX using Pandoc.

## Concrete Practice

This provides a guided activity to allow learners to demonstrate their skills and understanding of the topic area.
