# Readable Tests Concepts

## Coding Tests by Intention

Tests should be coded consistently with a well defined clear intent

Four phases are standard:

- Setup / Arrange â€“ Setup the initial state for the test
- Exercise / Act - Perform the action under test
- Verify / Assert - Determine and verify the outcome
- Cleanup - Clean up the state created

Each phase should be:

- Clearly Expressed
- Well documented

Expected Outcomes should be clearly expressed
